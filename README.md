# SQL Challenge

Included in this repo is a "EmployeeSQL" folder that contains a "data" folder, a SQL table schemata file, a SQL queries file, and a picture of the corresponding ERD. Located in the "data" folder are CSV files that are required to populate the created SQL tables and queries. These queries perform the following tasks:

- List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

- List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

- List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

- List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

- List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

- List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

- List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
